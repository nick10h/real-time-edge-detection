            I have Created a real time edge detection system which detects upto 17 points over human joints through my creation of a real-time human pose detection system using PoseNet and JavaScript, a realm of transformative applications unfolds. This cutting-edge technology serves as a game-changer in modifying games, enhancing virtual reality experiences, contributing to space science endeavors and many other projects/Fields of Sci-Fic where Imagination meets science in the real world. In the gaming arena, it introduces unparalleled interactivity, enabling users to control characters through natural movements. In virtual reality, it elevates immersion by accurately replicating users' physical gestures. Furthermore, in space science, this system aids researchers in studying astronauts' movements and conducting simulations for extraterrestrial environments. The fusion of PoseNet and JavaScript not only redefines user engagement in entertainment but also propels advancements in scientific exploration, fostering innovation across diverse domains.
